            <h2>I-The evolution of transistors:</h2>
            <p>
              The transistor, a tiny device controlling electric flow like a
              switch, revolutionized electronics. Invented in 1947 by Bardeen,
              Shockley, and Brattain, it replaced bulky, power-hungry vacuum
              tubes, paving the way for smaller computers like the ENIAC. This
              innovation, with its ability to amplify and switch electrical
              signals, is considered a cornerstone of modern electronics.

            <h2>a- The bipolar junction transistor (BJT):</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 2rem">
              The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a versatile semiconductor
              device that uses both electrons and holes for current flow,
              allowing it to amplify or switch signals. Unlike its counterpart,
              the FET, BJTs utilize two pn junctions formed within a single
              crystal to control a larger current with a smaller one. While
              initially surpassed by point-contact transistors, BJTs' superior
              reliability led to their widespread use in integrated circuits,
              particularly for analog and digital functions in earlier
              computers. Though largely replaced by CMOS technology in modern
              computers, BJTs remain relevant for specific applications like
              high-voltage or high-frequency circuits, and even find their place
              in mixed-signal integrated circuits combining both analog and
              digital functionalities.

              voltage-controlled semiconductor device with three terminals.
              Unlike bipolar transistors, JFETs don't require current to
              operate. They control current flow by adjusting a channel using a
              voltage applied to the gate. This allows them to function as
              switches, variable resistors, or even amplifiers. JFETs come in
              n-type and p-type variations, and offer high input impedance,
              making them suitable for various electronic applications.
